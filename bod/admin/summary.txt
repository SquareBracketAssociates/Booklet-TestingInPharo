Pharo is a modern, dynamically-typed, reflective, and pure object-oriented programming language - http://www.pharo.org. 

Pharo inherits and enhances the testing spirit from its ancestor Smalltalk. Indeed, Pharoâ€™s SUnit framework is the one of key asset of Agile Development as brought forward by K. Beck in its Test-Driven Development seminal book.

But Pharo is much more powerful. It defines and supports eXtreme Test-Driven Development, a.k.a TDD on Steriods. Unique to Pharo, eXtreme Test-Driven Development is a powerful development technique that puts live objects at the center of the coding experience. With its unique flow, it delivers an excellent and unforeseen productivity mixing a fully live programming environment with TDD.

In this book you will learn all the elements around TDD and XTDD. You will be empowered and understand why writing tests is not a side effect but a key element of the development process.
Once immersed into XTDD you will not program the same way anymore.
